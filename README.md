# Multiple Linear Regression for Profit Prediction
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict a company's profit based on various expenditures and the company's state. The model takes into account the following factors:

R&D Spend: Investment in research and development.
Administration: Administrative expenses.
Marketing Spend: Investment in marketing activities.
State: The location of the company, which may impact the profit due to regional economic conditions.
## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, and splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Trains a Multiple Linear Regression model on the provided dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
Profit Prediction: Uses the trained model to predict profit based on new input data.
